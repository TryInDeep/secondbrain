🧠 What’s a Second Brain?
 
A Second Brain is a personal knowledge management system — your digital memory. It’s where you capture, organize, and connect ideas, notes, and learnings so you can focus on thinking, creating, and building instead of remembering everything.
 
📥 Capture: Save ideas, notes, code snippets, articles.
 
🗂️ Organize: Structure with systems like PARA.
 
🔍 Retrieve: Quickly find what you need when you need it.
 
💡 Create: Turn raw info into blogs, projects, or insights.
 
 
Think of it as your personal library + idea factory 💡🚀
